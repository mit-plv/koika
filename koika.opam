synopsis: "A core language for rule-based hardware design ü¶ëÔ∏è"
description:
  "K√¥ika is a hardware design language inspired by BlueSpec SystemVerilog. K√¥ika programs are built from rules, small bits of hardware that operate concurrently to compute state updates but provide the illusion of serializable (atomic) updates. K√¥ika has simple, precise semantics that give you strong guarantees about the behavior of your designs."
